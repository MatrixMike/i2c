on optiplex running 17.1 rebecca LM there exists /dev/i2c-0 files but i2cdetect does not recognise them.
I need to find out how and why to enable this.


google -> `/dev/i2c-0': No such device or address
also recall that SMbus is a name used to refer to similar system

lm-sensors and sensors-detect
